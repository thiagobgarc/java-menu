# Java Menu

This project is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) application written in Java, titled **Java Menu**. It’s another quick and simple project created to apply and reinforce the skills I’ve learned on my journey to becoming a Java developer. The application presents a list of coffee options, allows the user to select their preferred coffee, and displays the corresponding price.

## Features

- **Coffee Selection**: The application displays a menu of various coffee options.
- **Price Display**: Shows the price of the selected coffee based on user input.
- **Error Handling**: Uses `try-catch` blocks to gracefully manage input errors.
- **Case-Insensitive Input**: The program recognizes coffee names regardless of their case (e.g., "Macchiato" or "macchiato").

## Key Concepts Applied

- **For Loops**: Used to iterate over arrays and display coffee options.
- **If Statements and Switch Cases**: Used to handle user choices and display corresponding prices.
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Implemented to handle invalid inputs and prevent program crashes.
- **Arrays**: Used to store coffee names and their prices.
- **User Input Handling**: Uses the `Scanner` class to capture user input from the terminal.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffee-menu.git
   cd coffee-menu
   java main
